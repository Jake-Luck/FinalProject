\subsection{Problem Description}\label{subsec:problem-description}
Given a positive integer: $d$, the number of days in the trip; a graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is set of locations
including a designated starting point $s$, and $E$ is a set of weighted edges linking every location to every other
location; and a duration function $D(v), v \in V$, which assigns a visit duration to each node $v$, find a route that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Visits all nodes $V \setminus s$ once.
    \item Starts and finishes at $s$, having visited it $d$ times, without ever visiting consecutively.
    \item Minimises both the cumulative edge weights in the route and the variance in cumulative weight between
    each visit to $s$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Inputs, Outputs and Design Variables}\label{subsec:inputs-and-outputs}
Inputs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $d$: The number of times $s$ should be visited in a route.
    Contextually, $d$ represents the number of days a tourist will spend on their trip. $d \in \mathbb{Z}, d > 0$
    \item $D(v)$: A duration functions that assigns a duration to each location.
    Contextually this represents the amount of time a tourist would like to spend visiting each point of location.
    \item $G = (V, E)$: A pair comprising:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\textbullet] $V$: A set of nodes representing locations the tourist would like to visit.
        $v \in V, v = (x, y, t)$, a triple comprising:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[\textbullet]$x$: Longitude, indicating the location's geographic east-west position on the earth
            $x \in \mathbb{Q}, -180 \leq x \leq 180$.
            \item[\textbullet]$y$: Latitude, indicating the location's geographic north-south position on the earth
            $y \in \mathbb{Q}, -90 \leq y \leq 90$.
        \end{itemize}
        \item[\textbullet] $E$: A set of edges $e \in E$ that connects every node to every other node,
        bidirectionally. $e = (v_1, v_2, w)$, a triple comprising:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[\textbullet]$v_1$: A location representing the origin of the edge.\\
            $v_1 \in V$.
            \item[\textbullet]$v_2$: A location representing the destination of the edge.\\
            $v_2 \in V$.
            \item[\textbullet]$w$: A weight indicating the sum of the time it takes to travel from $v_1$ to $v_2$
            and the time the tourist wishes to spent at $v_2$.\\
            $w \in Z, w > 0$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item $s$: Starting point that should be visited $d$ times.
    Contextually, $s$ represents where the tourist is staying and will return to at the end of each day.\\
    $s \in V$.
\end{itemize}
Outputs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $R$: A valid route satisfying all constraints, represented as an ordered sequence of locations.\\
    $R = [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n], r_i \in V$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objective Function}\label{subsec:objective-function}
As previously mentioned in the \hyperref[subsec:problem-description]{Problem Description}, the goal of this problem is
to find a route that minimises the cumulative weight and the variance in route weight between each visit to $s$.
To accomplish this the following cost function is applied to each route:
\begin{equation}
    Cost(R) = W/d \times (1 + \sigma^2)\label{eq:cost}
\end{equation}
Where $W$ is the sum of the weights of all edges traversed in the route and $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the
sum of weights between each visit to $s$:
\begin{equation}
    W = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w(r_i, r_{i+1}) + D(v_i), r_i \in R, v_i \in V\label{eq:weight}
\end{equation}
Where $w(r_i, r_{i+1})$ is the weight of the edge between $r_i$ and $r_{i+1}$.
\begin{equation}
    \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{d}(x_i-\mu)}{d}, x_i \in X\label{eq:standard-deviation}
\end{equation}
Where $R$ is divided into sections between each visit to $s$ and $X$ is a list of the sum of weights within these
sections.\\
$\mu$ is the mean cumulative weight of each $x_i$.

\subsection{Constraints}\label{subsec:problem-constraints}
A valid solution must satisfy the following constraints:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The route must visit every node $v \in \{V \setminus s\}$ exactly once:\\
    $\forall_{v \in \{V \setminus s\}}, |\{i \in \{1, \mathellipsis, n\}: r_i = v\}| = 1$
    \item The route must visit $s$ exactly $d$ times:\\
    $|\{i \in \{1, \mathellipsis, n\}: r_i = s\}| = d$
    \item The route must not visit $s$ consecutively:\\
    $\forall_{i \in \{1, \mathellipsis, n-1\}}, r_i \neq r_{i+1}$
    \item The route must end at $s$:\\
    $r_n = s$
\end{itemize}
