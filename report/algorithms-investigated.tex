\todo{Paragraph describing different types of algorithm used (Routing then cluster, Cluster then Routing, Genetic, etc.)}
\todo{Remember to justify the choice of algorithms. You may also need to explain how to adopt these algorithms in your work. A figure showing the ralationship between different components of your work may also help.}
\subsection{Routing}\label{subsec:routing}
\todo{Explain purpose of routing/goal of algorithms.}
\subsubsection{Brute Force}\label{subsubsec:brute-force-routing}
\todo{Write brute force explanation}
