    \subsection{Motivation}\label{subsec:motivation}
    \todo{Write about reasoning for this project, can copy a little bit over from presentation slides. Explain problem informally. Link into aims and objectives.}
    \subsection{Aims and Objectives}\label{subsec:aims-and-objectives}
    \todo{Explin goals of the project, link in to methodology.}
    \subsection{Methodology}\label{subsec:methodology}
    \todo{Briefly explain how the project will be carried out. A more thorough description can be provided later on, i.e., when describing algorithms.}
    \subsection{Summary}\label{subsec:summary}
    \todo{Explain what is in the rest of the report. "In this report I shall...", cover each section, etc.}

    \todo{Plan (and write) literature review}
    \todo{Remember to write about the strengths and weaknesses of existing work. At the end of this chapter you can then give a summary of the gaps that you'll be trying to improve with your work, and on the strengths that you will be maintaining in your work.}

    \todo{Write paragraph about experiment process. Comparison based on computation time and route evaluation.
    Describe how route is evaluated. Describe data being tested on.}
    \todo{Present comparison of different combinations of algorithms on different inputs.}
    \todo{Reflect about the questionns you are trying to answer with your evaluation. You can have onne subsection for each question that you are trying to answer. It's also important to justify your choices when it comes to the methodology used for evaluation.}
