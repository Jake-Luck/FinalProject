    \section*{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}
    The Multi-Day Trip Planning problem presented in this report is a combinatorial optimisation problem that aims
    to plan a trip across multiple days, visiting a specified set of locations.
    The problem is optimised according to the amount of time spent travelling in the trip, and the balance of time
    spent across each day.
    An effective solution to this problem would allow a user to easily plan trips that efficiently visit the locations
    they wish to see.

    In this report a number of different approaches to solving this problem are investigated, including algorithms
    shown to be effective in similar optimisation problems.
    These approaches are evaluated against each other to try and determine the most practical solutions to the problem.
    By the end of this report it is shown that a combination of genetic clustering algorithms with approximate and
    exact routing methods seem to be the most promising approaches.
